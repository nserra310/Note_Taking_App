Note-Taker-App
Creating a web application that you can create, store, and delete notes.

* This is a web application using express.js and different methods in order to GET, POST, and then DELETE in order to create notes, store them as a data.json file.

* In order run the app you must run an npm i while inside the proper develop folder in order to get the proper node_modules.

* Once that is complete you would run "node server.js" in the terminal in order to establish a connection.

* To actually open the page you would go to your web browser and type in "localhost:3000" or whatever number you named your connection.

* This brings you in to the index page with the button you click in order to open the note taking application.

* When you arrive on this page you are able to create a note title and note body and then once finished you click on the little floppy disk icon in order to save your note which is stored as a data.json file.

* The title and note will appear on the right hand side along with a red trash can icon which you could use in order to delete any specific note you chose.
